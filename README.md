# vimfind

vimfind is a tool to make your unix life easier.

```
$ cd vimfind
$ install
$ bundle install
```

To look in the current directory for the file with keywords,

```
$ vf [keyword1] [keyword2]
```

If you add ? as prefix, it can grep through the file content.
```
$vf ?[keyword]
```

Of course, you can combine the above two.
